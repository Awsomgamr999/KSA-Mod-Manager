# Security Policy

KSAMM is a project created, updated, and otherwise managed by a single person. I am the only one who has access to commit to this repository. However, I am not liable if somehow someone manages to insert malicious code. THe cource code is included with the download so you should be reading it yourself.

The version supported for bugs is whatever is the current release.
